/*
 * A simple example program demonstrating the WolframAlpha.jar library. The program
 * performs a query given on the command line and prints out the resulting pod titles
 * and plaintext content.
 * 
 * You will need to insert your appid into the code. To compile or run this program
 * you will need the following dependent libraries on your classpath (including 
 * WolframAlpha.jar, of course):
 * 
 *     commons-codec-1.3.jar
 *     httpclient-4.0.1.jar
 *     httpcore-4.0.1.jar
 *     commons-logging.jar
 *     
 * These libraries are widely available on the Internet. You can probably use other version
 * numbers than these, although these are the versions I used.
 * 
 * To launch from the command line, do the following (these classpath specifications assume
 * that the WolframAlpha.jar file and the four other dependent jars listed above are in the same
 * directory as AlphaAPISample.class):
 * 
 *     Windows:
 *     
 *       java -classpath .;* AlphaAPISample "sin x"
 *     
 *     Linux, Mac OSX:
 *     
 *       java -classpath .:* AlphaAPISample "sin x"
